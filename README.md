# SteelDefectClassification
This project is based on the analysis of surface defects of coils in steel, and combines the deep transfer learning algorithm, which is the core technology of artificial intelligence, to recognize and classify defects. 
Improving the quality of coil detection and enterprise productivity.

In this study, the classification of defects on the steel surface is made. The summary of the study is as follows:

Will see Support Vector Machines and Random Forest classifiers Presentation of results by confusion matrix and classification report
